	<em style="color:red;">THIS HELP IS OUT OF DATE ALREADY, IT STILL SORT OF APPLIES</em><br />
	<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO??</strong><br /><br />

	You can DIG the ground (d) and get MONEY, where you can go to the SHOP and buy SEEDS to allow you to grow (s) FLOWERS
	you can then HARVEST those FLOWERS to get POINTS, other ways to get points include breaking ROCKS and building STATUES (b). 
	Oh! and you get randomly INJURED when you walk on the grass, PATHS are safe.<br /><br />

	<strong>RULE ONE:</strong><br />
	If your HEALTH goes ORANGE then you could be injured (up to 15hp), RED means you HAVE been injured and GREEN is safe.</p>

	<strong>RULE TWO:</strong><br />
	If you are in minus (negative) points, you will lose a point per move until you get out of it!<br /><br />

	<strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>
	D = dig<br />
	B = Place statue<br />
	E = Eat fish<br />
	S = plant seed (chance of gold plant!)<br />
	R = repair shovel and get a free hammer<br />
	Up, Down, Left, Right = move<br /><br />

	<strong>POINTS, PRIZES and COSTS:</strong>
	<xmp>
	(!) = walk into the object.

	(f) Fishing	=	10pts	|	0money		|	10money
	(d) Digging	=	0pts	|	Up to 30money	|	15money for tools
	(b) Statues	=	20pts	|	0money		|	25money per brick

	</xmp>

	<strong>HINT:</strong><br />
